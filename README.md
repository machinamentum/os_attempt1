# os_attempt1

Some kernel-level code that runs at system boot. I was experimenting with this stuff in my free time in 2018, but have moved on (and if I am to try this again, I would wirte it in [Jiyu](https://github.com/machinamentum/jiyu), not C).
Recommended environment is Qemu with a VMware SVGA adapter (see run.bat).
An appropriate i686-elf toolchain with Qemu and nasm can be found [here](https://github.com/machinamentum/i686-elf-tools/releases/download/8.1.0/i686-elf-tools+qemu-windows.zip).
Just extract the zip to the root folder of project and run build.bat.

There is an example of what this project looks like in [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/machinamentum/status/1048483441623388162?s=20).
